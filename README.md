# text-classification
Hello There,
This repository contains code details of my capstone project undertaken as part of SpringBoard AI & Machine Learning program. 

Capstone project I undertook is to build a model to classify text in images and videos.

Project Description: 
Task is to identify text in an image or a video stream. Text can be hand written, printed or in any font. It can include numeric or alphabet characters. Image can be of a landscape, sign board, house number etc. Initially, limit the project to numeric and english alphabets. 

Below are the dataset details I used to train and test the model. 

1. Kaggle MNIST competition dataset containing dand written digits:
