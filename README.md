# text-classification
Hello There,
This repository contains code details of project I undertook to build a model to classify text in images and videos.

Project Description: 
Task is to identify text in an image or a video stream. Text can be hand written, printed or in any font. It can include numeric or alphabet characters. Image can be of a landscape, sign board, house number etc. Initially, limit the project to numeric and english alphabets. 

Below are the dataset details I used to train and test the model. 

1. Kaggle MNIST competition dataset containing dand written digits:

NOTE:
This repository has few jupyter notebook files. These files might not open directly in github for understandable reasons. One way to open such files is to download to your local system and then open in jupyter. Another quick way is to use nbviewer along with the notebook's github url. For-example, if github url is:
https://github.com/dineshydv1/text-classification/blob/master/Few%20Steps%20with%20keras.ipynb
then open this with below url:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dineshydv1/text-classification/blob/master/Few%20Steps%20with%20keras.ipynb
